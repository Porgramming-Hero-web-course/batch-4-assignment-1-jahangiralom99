# Handling Asynchronous Operations with Async/Await in TypeScript

Asynchronous programming is essential for building responsive applications, especially when handling operations that take time, such as data fetching. In JavaScript and TypeScript, asynchronous operations are typically managed using callbacks, promises, or the `async/await` syntax.

This guide explains how to handle asynchronous operations using `async/await` in TypeScript, offering a cleaner, more readable approach than traditional callbacks or promises.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Promise?

A Promise is an object representing the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. Promises allow us to handle actions that take time in a structured way. A Promise can be in one of three states:

- **Pending**: The operation has not yet completed.
- **Fulfilled**: The operation completed successfully, and the result is available.
- **Rejected**: The operation failed, and an error is available.

### Async/Await in TypeScript

The `async/await` syntax is built on top of Promises and offers a simpler way to write asynchronous code, making it look more like synchronous code. Using `async/await` can make your code easier to read and maintain.

## Usage Example

### 1. Defining an Async Function

To define an async function, use the `async` keyword before the function. An async function automatically returns a Promise.

```typescript
async function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
    return "Data fetched";
}
